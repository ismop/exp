# This migration comes from atmosphere (originally 20150103133015)
# The purpose of this migration is to move the 'prepaid_until' column from Atmosphere::Appliance to Atmosphere::Deployment
# The reason for this is that an Appliance may have multiple deployments and new deployments may be added on the fly
# while the Appliance is running - in such cases, it is no longer sufficient to store a global 'prepaid_until' timestamp
# for the whole Appliance - rather, the billing system must iterate over the Appliance's deployments and bill each one
# separately.

    # Time for some good old-fashioned SQL because the Rails ORM model is too constraining to support current timestamp as default datetime
    execute "ALTER TABLE atmosphere_deployments ADD COLUMN prepaid_until TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"

    # Now we need to iterate over existing Appliances and rewrite the relevant data in order to maintain appliance info
