# Requirements

## Supported Operating Systems

- Ubuntu 12.04
- Ubuntu 14.04

It may be possible to install EXP on other operating systems. The above list
only includes operating systems, which have **already** been used for EXP
deployment in production mode. What is more, some commands used in the
installation manual are Debian-specific (e.g. `apt-get`). If your OS uses a
different package management system, you will need to modify these commands
appropriately (e.g. by calling `yum` if you are using CentOS).

## Ruby versions

EXP requires Ruby (MRI) 2.1.

# Hardware requirements

## CPU

**2 cores** is the **recommended** minimum number of cores.

## Memory

**6GB** is the **recommended** minimum memory size.

Notice: The 25 workers of Sidekiq will show up as separate processes in your
process overview (such as top or htop) but they share the same RAM allocation
since Sidekiq is a multithreaded application.

## Storage

The following components must reside in your attached storage:

- EXP codebase (30MB)
- EXP dependencies - gems (1GB)
- Application logs (3GB)
- EXP database (Note: the volume of the database depends on how many compute
sites will be integrated and how many Appliance Types and Appliances will be
registered. 100MB should be enough for standard deployments.)

## Redis and Sidekiq

Redis manages the background task queue. Storage requirements for Redis are
minimal (on the order of 10 MB). Sidekiq processes background jobs using a
multithreaded process. This process starts along with the entire Rails stack
(1GB+) but it may grow over time, depending of the number of compute sites
integrated with EXP and the number of instance-bound HTTP endpoints which
need to be monitored. On a heavily loaded server the Sidekiq process may
allocate 2GB+ of memory.
